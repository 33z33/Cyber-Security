- **Authentication**- It is any process by which a system verifies the identity of a user who wishes to access it.
- **Non- repudiation**– It means to ensure that a transferred message has been sent and received by the parties claiming to have sent and received the message. Non-repudiation is a way to guarantee that the sender of a message cannot later deny having sent the message and that the recipient cannot deny having received the message.
- **Integrity**– to ensure that the message was not altered during the transmission.

### Digital Signature

A digital signature is a mathematical technique which validates the authenticity and integrity of a message, software or digital documents. It allows us to verify the author name, date and time of signatures, and authenticate the message contents.

### Digital Certificate

[What is Digital Certificate] (Must Read) https://help.utk.edu/kb/index.php?func=show&e=1960

Digital certificates are electronic credentials that bind the identity of the certificate owner to a pair of electronic encryption keys, (one public and one private), that can be used to encrypt and sign information digitally. The main purpose of the digital certificate is to ensure that the public key contained in the certificate belongs to the entity to which the certificate was issued, in other words, to verify that a person sending a message is who he or she claims to be, and to then provide the message receiver with the means to encode a reply back to the sender.
